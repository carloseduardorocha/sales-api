> **Important:**  
> To enable the email system, it is **mandatory** to properly configure the email-related environment variables in your `.env` file.

## âš™ Environment Configuration

### Admin User Credentials

When seeding the database, a default admin user will be created based on the following `.env` variables:

```env
TEST_USER_NAME="Test User"
TEST_USER_EMAIL="test@example.com"
TEST_USER_PASSWORD="MyPassword25!"
```

- These credentials will be used for the login into the system.
- The admin email configured here will also receive the sales report emails.
- **If you want to change the admin information, you must edit it now in the `.env` file before running the seeders.**

### Email Configuration

To properly send emails, configure the following environment variables:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_SCHEME=null
MAIL_HOST=mailpit
MAIL_PORT=1025
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="hello@example.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

Make sure to adjust these settings according to your email provider or mail server.
